# 828 Construction — Current Status

_Update this file after every session. It's loaded by memory at session start._

## Remediation Page V3 — Joe's Video Verbiage Batch (2026-07-08 night)

`/services/remediation` rebuilt from Joe's 4 feedback videos (IMG_1103/1111/
1112/1113, OneDrive\Pictures); change doc
`docs/828_REMEDIATION_JOE_FEEDBACK_2026-07-08.md`, verbiage now FROZEN.
Structure: "828 — creating healthier environments…" asymmetric hero →
"When mold remediation is necessary" FAQ cards (light zone, header morphs) →
"The approach / Build philosophy" 01–04 focus rows + sticky photo →
re-verbiaged method section ("828's integrated remediation and restoration
approach…") → "Where recovery begins" CTA + Flair E8 / 277 MR equipment
plates (page signature; REAL EQUIPMENT PHOTOS PENDING from Joe — his note
attaches a picture but it's unreadable in video). FAQPage JSON-LD added.
QA: tsc clean, remediation-fixes functional-qa PASS desktop+mobile (0 console
errors — the old mount warning is gone with the rewrite), npm run
preflight:full exit 0. Leftover note copy not assigned on camera ("This
expertise had led to an advanced remediation process…") documented in the
change doc — confirm placement with Joe.

## ADU Page V3 — Joe's Video Verbiage Batch (2026-07-08 night)

`/services/adu` rebuilt from Joe's 4 feedback videos (IMG_1086/1092/1094/1095);
change doc `docs/828_ADU_JOE_FEEDBACK_2026-07-08.md`, verbiage now FROZEN.
Structure: vertical "Built with intent" hero → FAQ card grid (light zone,
header morphs) → "What ADU means to 828." A/D/U rows + drifting watermark →
"An invitation to work together" + 01–04 qualifying questions. QA: tsc clean,
adu-fixes functional-qa PASS desktop+mobile, site-smoke /services/adu OK.
Shipped to ns-preview (branch + https://828-ns-preview.vercel.app).
Pre-existing, untouched, still open: /services/remediation React
state-update-warning on mount; header BOOK CALL button absent (smoke script
expects it). Services landing V3 (prior batch) was still uncommitted in the
working tree when this session started.

## Push + Local Cleanup Handoff (2026-05-26)

Requested action was `PUSH AND CLEAN`. No source changes were pending at the start. `git push` ran the repo pre-push gate, which performed a full production build and route audit; all 16 desktop/mobile route checks plus nav/SplitType cleanup and hard-refresh stability passed.

- Latest pushed commit before notes: `44ae824 chore: update preflight marker`
- Latest preflight report: `.claude-work/preflight/2026-05-26-21-09/report.json`
- Verification from push hook: `npm run preflight:full` equivalent, 16/16 route checks passing
- Safe local cleanup performed: removed `.next`, server logs, Playwright report/output, and TypeScript build info; did not remove `.env.local`, `node_modules`, source files, docs, or client assets
- Local servers on `3001`, `4000`, `4001`, and `4028` were stopped after cleanup
- Working tree was clean and `main` matched `origin/main` after pushing the updated preflight marker

## Sitewide Cleanup + Production QA (2026-05-21)

All public routes were visually reviewed at desktop and mobile, portfolio imagery was pulled back from generated-looking live project slots, page metadata titles were normalized, and about-page mid-scroll image loading was hardened.

- Latest report: `.claude-work/preflight/2026-05-21-22-57/report.json`
- Verification: `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`, `npm run build`, production desktop+mobile visual audit, `npx playwright test tests/portfolio-production.spec.ts --project=chromium`, `npx playwright test tests/stress.spec.ts --project=chromium --workers=1`, `npm run preflight:full`

## Local Dev Port Pin (2026-05-21)

This repo is permanently pinned to `http://localhost:3001` for local development. `npm run dev` runs `next dev -p 3001`. Port `3000` is another local app and must not be used to review 828 Construction.

## Portfolio Production Hardening + Client-Ready QA (2026-05-21)

Portfolio case-index preview, client-facing project imagery, contact above-fold image visibility, and stress tests were hardened for production refresh/navigation use.

- Latest report: `.claude-work/preflight/2026-05-21-20-51/report.json`
- Verification: `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`, `npm run build`, production route/image audit at desktop+mobile, `npx playwright test tests/portfolio-production.spec.ts --project=chromium`, `npx playwright test tests/stress.spec.ts --project=chromium --workers=1`, `npm run preflight:full`

## Mobile Polish + Image Loading Hardening (2026-05-20)

Shared header/footer tap targets, services mobile spacing, and portfolio/lightbox image loading were tightened. Full production preflight passed with all 16 route/viewport checks plus nav cleanup and hard-refresh stability.

- Latest report: `.claude-work/preflight/2026-05-20-19-55/report.json`
- Verification: `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`, `npm run build`, `npm run preflight:full`
